task 0 - a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

task 1 - a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

task 2 -  a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line

task 3 -  a function that checks for lowercase character

task 4 - a function that checks for alphabetic character.

task 5 -  a function that prints the sign of a number.

task 6 - a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

task 7 -  a function that prints the last digit of a number.

task 8 - a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

task 9 -  a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

task 10 -  a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

task 11 -  a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
		Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);
		Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
		Numbers should be printed in order
		The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
		The last printed number should be 98

task 12 - a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.
		Prototype: void print_times_table(int n);
		If n is greater than 15 or less than 0 the function should not print anything

task 13 -  a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.

task 14 - a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
		The numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space , 
		You are allowed to use the standard library

task 15 -  By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, this is a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms, 
	followed by a new line.

task 16 - a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
